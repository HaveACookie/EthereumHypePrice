<h1>Getting Twitter Data</h1>


<p>The Information about the ethereum related tweets was obtained from <a href=https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-tweets.html#3y>BitinfoCharts</a> I orignally wanted to use the actual twitter api but I needed a special research liscence to get the information I needed. Bitinfocharts, however, has the data of tweets per day of #Ethereum. To get this data I Scraped website using <a href="https://github.com/logic-language/bitinfochartscraper"> BitinfoChartScraper</a>, an open source project that can be used to parse data from the graphs on the bitinfochart website. To retrieve this data manually, you can run the code and take the ethereum_eth.csv that is generated at the end of it. If you would like to access the data without running this code, it is located in this folder as well as on my github repository for this project <a href="https://github.com/HaveACookie/BigDataEther"> located here</a> it is listed as ethereum_eth.csv. It is also located on the base folder of my peel directory. Please notify me if you run into any issues with this.</p>
